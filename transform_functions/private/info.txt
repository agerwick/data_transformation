This is where you place your own transform functions that are not supposed to be committed to the git repository.
The directory is excluded in .gitignore .

If you have a transform_function that could be useful for other people and you wish to share, add it to transform_functions/public and create a pull request on github:
https://github.com/agerwick/data_transformation
