This is where you place your own transform functions that are not supposed to be committed to the git repository.
The directory is excluded in .gitignore .

It is recommended that you place your transform functions in subdirectories to this directory, named after the company or project, for example "project_x".
Let's say you have a file called special_transformations.py.
In here you have defined a function called "extract_special_data".
You can then import the transform functions by adding this 
    "import": [
        {
            "module": "transform_functions.private.project_x.special_transformations",
            "functions": ["extract_special_data"]
        }
    ]

You can find a transform function template here:
public/transform_function_template.py

If you have a transform_function that could be useful for other people and you wish to share, add it to transform_functions/public and create a pull request on github:
